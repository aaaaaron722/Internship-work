[Fig.1.] This is what the main user interface looks like.

During this project, I learned many new techniques that I had never been exposed to before. In school, we mainly focused on theory without much practical implementation. This opportunity allowed me to understand how to build websites and develop apps, which I really enjoyed. At the time, I was a junior and hadn't studied SQL or databases yet. Through this work, I began learning about databases and SQL syntax, and by the end, I was able to create databases and restore data independently.
